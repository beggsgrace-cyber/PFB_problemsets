Grace by Shel Silverstein

Grace loves me,
Grace cares,
Grace picks me peaches and pears.
Grace offers me candy and Cokes,
Grace listens and laughs at me jokes.
Grace helps when I get in a fight,
Grace does all my homework at night.
Grace misses me,
Grace cries,
Grace thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Grace is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Grace just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Grace's hand,
In the darkness where Grace usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Grace's gone!
